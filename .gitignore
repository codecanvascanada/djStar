# This .gitignore file is for Unity projects.
#
# Typically, you would place this file at the root of your Unity project
# folder. It specifies which files and directories Git should ignore,
# ensuring that only relevant project assets and code are tracked.

# Custom: DO NOT IGNORE AssetBundles, as the user wants to track them.
# If /AssetBundles/ were uncommented, Git would ignore everything in that folder.
# /AssetBundles/

# Assets/ServerMock is automatically included because Assets/ is not ignored.
# Add custom ignore rules here if needed.
# For example, to ignore specific large assets within Assets/:
# Assets/SomeBigAsset.psd

# Ignore large media files that should be in AssetBundles, not in Git.
Assets/**/*.mp3
Assets/**/*.wav
Assets/**/*.ogg
Assets/**/*.mp4
Assets/**/*.mov
Assets/**/*.png
Assets/**/*.jpg
Assets/**/*.jpeg
Assets/**/*.psd

# Ignore the Recordings folder
